# Daily Work Day Scheduler
A daily planner for the user to organize tasks for their day.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this daily planner application to work on my developer skills particularly with DOM manipulation, working with outside libraries such as dayjs, functions, loops, localstorage usage, objects, setting timeouts, etc. This is also a great way for me to keep track of my daily tasks!
- I created this project to work on my javascript skills particularly with manipulating the DOM, using and manipulating objects, working with outside libraries, using the local storage, setting timeouts, and using functions.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of learning an application works that takes a users input for daily tasks and saves it. It also helped me to work with a system where the color of the boxes changes depending on what time of the day it is.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript in real life applications. Particularly, using outside libraries in order to get updated information to be displayed on the screen. It also helps to get the data and manipulate it as I want to to work with my page.

- When the user enters the application, they are immediately met with what time of the day it is - based off what the color coding is of the different sections.
- When a user enters any information into the sections, they then have the option to click the save button. When they choose to save, they can come back later and the text will still be there.
- The user will also be alerted to what time it is based on the title at the top of the page which displays this.
